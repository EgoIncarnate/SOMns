# Change Log

## [Unreleased]

 - Added basic support for shared-memory multithreading and fork/join
   programming ([PR #52](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/52))
   - object model uses now a global safepoint to synchronize layout changes
   - array strategies are not safe yet

 - Turn writes to method arguments into errors. Before it was leading to 
   confusing setter sends and 'message not understood' errors.

 - Added Lee and Vacation benchmarks ([PR #78](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/78))

 - Configuration flag for actor tracing, -atcfg=<config>
   example: -atcfg=mt:mp:pc turns off message timestamps, message parameters and promises

 - Added Validation benchmarks and a new Harness.

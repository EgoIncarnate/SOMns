# Change Log

## [Unreleased]

 - Added basic support for shared-memory multithreading and fork/join
   programming ([PR #52](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/52))
   - object model uses now a global safepoint to synchronize layout changes
   - array strategies are not safe yet

 - Turn writes to method arguments into errors. Before it was leading to 
   confusing setter sends and 'message not understood' errors.

 - Added Lee and Vacation benchmarks ([PR #78](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/78))

 - Configuration flag for actor tracing, -atcfg=<config>
   example: -atcfg=mt:mp:pc turns off message timestamps, message parameters and promises

 - Added Validation benchmarks and a new Harness.
 
 - Simplified AST inlining and use objects to represent variable info to improve
   details displayed in debugger ([PR #80](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/80)).

 - Make instrumentation more robust by defining number of arguments of an
   operation explicitly.
  
 - Add parse-time specialization of primitives. This enables very early 
   knowledge about the program, which might be unreliable, but should be good
   enough for tooling. (See [Issue #75](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/issues/75) and [PR #88](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/88))

 - Added basic Communicating Sequential Processes support.
   See [PR #84](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/88).

 - Added CSP version of PingPong benchmark.

 - Added simple STM implementation. See `s.i.t.Transactions` and [PR #81](https://github.com/smarr/SOMns/pull/81) for details.

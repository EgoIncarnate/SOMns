SOMns-core-lib - The Core Library for a Simple Newspeak Implementation
======================================================================


SOMns is derived from [SOM][SOM] and sticks with its minimalism by only
including features when they are actually needed.

This repository contains the standard library of SOMns, without an actual VM
implementation. Please see the [main project repository][SOMns] for the VM
implementation.
